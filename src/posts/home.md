# A little about me

Hi, I'm Matt,

I started learning to code in 2017 because I wanted to build a 3D scanner to digitize my cats and print miniature figurines of them.

Since then, software development has become my full time job. Professionally, I've spent time building and embedding analytics dashboards into webapps, creating API endpoints, and building data pipelines.

I started this site as a place to share projects that I've worked on and my thoughts around mostly technology related topics.

Here are some technologies I've worked with:

<b>Languages:</b> Python, JavaScript, SQL, Node.js, CSS, SASS, HTML<br>
<b>Notable Frameworks and Libraries:</b> Flask, Vue.js, Pandas, Vuex, Airflow<br>
<b>Databases:</b> PostGreSQL, BigQuery, MySQL, Firebase<br>
<b>Dashboarding:</b> Looker, Periscope, Tableau, Chartio<br>
<b>Misc:</b> Git/Gitflow, Docker, Webpack, TDD, Agile/Scrum, Jira, SalesForce (administration), 3D Modelling/Printing
