# A little about me

Hi, I'm Matt,

I'm a software engineer based out of Toronto.

I started learning to code in 2017 because I wanted to [build a 3D scanner](https://www.matthewbell.dev/blog/building-pet-scanning-booth) to digitize my cats and print miniature figurines of them.

Since then, software development has become my full time job. I've spent time working on APIs, building and embedding analytics dashboards into webapps, and building data pipelines.

I started this site as a place to share projects that I've worked on and my thoughts on mostly tech related topics.

Here are some technologies I'm skilled with:

<b>Languages:</b> Python, JavaScript, SQL, Node.js, CSS, SASS, HTML<br>
<b>Notable Frameworks and Libraries:</b> Flask, Vue, React, Pandas, Vuex, Airflow<br>
<b>Databases:</b> PostGreSQL, BigQuery, MySQL, Firebase, Redis<br>
<b>Dashboarding:</b> Looker, Periscope, Tableau, Chartio<br>
<b>Misc:</b> Git/Gitflow, Docker, Webpack, TDD, Agile/Scrum, Jira, SalesForce (administration), 3D Modelling/Printing
