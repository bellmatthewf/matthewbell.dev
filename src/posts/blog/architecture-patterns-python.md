# Learning Architecture Patterns with Python

> I wouldn't implement it like that in production, but it's fine to do it like that in a basic CRUD app.

It feels like there's a canyon sized gap when learning to code. When I was learning [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/), I started by watching YouTube tutorials by a popular python content creator, [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/c/Coreyms/featured), and by reading the official Flask documentation, and I eventually even bought and read a popular O'Reilly textbook on Flask called [Flask Web Development](https://flaskbook.com/) by Miguel Grinberg to deepen my understanding.

Don't get me wrong, all three of these resources are nothing short of fantastic. But when it comes to working on an actual project it quickly becomes clear that the basics that taught in online tutorials and documentation aren't adequate for building a larger production ready application.

This always baffled me. At the time I was learning Flask I'd already been coding for a few years. I didn't have trouble grasping the basics of how it worked, but I struggled with how to go from building a basic CRUD app, like every tutorials shows how to do, to implementing more advanced architectural patterns that I hear more Senior devs talking about, like "ports and adapters" or the "service repository pattern".

Where is the Codecademy class on implementing the unit of work pattern in conjunction with Domain Driven Design?

It still felt like there was a missing piece of the puzzle that I didn't fully understand.

Where is everyone learning about this stuff. And why do I seem to be the only developer who doesn't know it? I've been wondering this for a while so I asked a couple of the more senior devs at my company where I should go to learn the fundamentals behind these patterns in depth.

Everyone that I asked recommended the book [Clean Code by Robert C. Martin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/). A 400+ page walloping mammoth of a textbook written entirely in Java. It didn't even have an animal on the cover. If this was what I needed to do to learn proper architectural patterns though, then I would do it.

I read <u>Clean Code</u> cover to cover, and while I did glean some information from it, a lot of it seemed targeted towards Java. And even more annoyingly, a lot of the principles presented as hard and fast rules were in fact extremely controversial in the wider programming community.

One easy to understand principle


 But I figured OK my job here is to figure out how can I apply this to Python



They recommended that I read

But where on earth is a Python

These types of resources are great for learning how to implement a basic
