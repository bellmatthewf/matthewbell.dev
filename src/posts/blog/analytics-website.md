This one is pretty self explanatory. This was a website I built with HTML/SASS. I built it when I was looking to work as a Data Analyst in early 2018.

The HTML/SASS it's built with is pretty barebones, so I won't spend time here talking about that, but the analytics cases in there are cool to check out! They typically use SQL + Python's Pandas library in conjunction with a visualization tool like Tableau.
