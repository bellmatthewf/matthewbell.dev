<b>The Idea</b>

A few years ago, I stumbled across a video of a company that 3D printed beautiful full color figurines of people and animals. I thought this was a cool business, but they had only one store in Toronto. I started to wonder how they would be able to scale that business model. How many people are going to be willing to travel to that one specific store to get themselves scanned and printed? I couldn't help but wonder - wouldn't the idea work better if you distributed 3D scanners all across the country. Then these scanners could send back the necessary files to a central location for printing. Then you could mail the end consumer their figurine directly.

I thought about it some more and did some more research. That should work, right? Sounds easy. I've done a fair amount of 3D printing, I could probably figure this out.

<b>The Planning Process</b>


<b>The Build</b>




I'd been doing a lot of 3D modelling and printing at the time and figured I could do that too.


I'd been spending a lot of time in the depths of 3D modelling softwares, working on custom fit 3D printed sleep apnea masks. The idea failed because of the complexities of the medical space and the intricacies required to produce it at scale (3D printing scales poorly). I thought there must be simpler applications for 3D printing that I can put my mind to.

What about 3D printing miniature figurines of peoople's pets?
